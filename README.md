 FIGHT COVID 2019                                                  	
We all know we are going through a dangerous virtual crisis i.e. COVID 2019 and we have to respond to this invisible enemy swiftly. The Central and State governments have taken various majors and are doing their best to contain the virus but we, the citizens do share an equal responsibilities. Before it infects further and goes to community spread maybe a few small steps from all citizens can help the authorities to manage it in time and technology can play a big role to contain the spread. At the same time keeping all of us vigilant and aware about the situation so that we all can take necessary measure as early as possible, and hence, I am proposing this centralized tracker.

	The very proposed idea is for not mass surveillance but to take timely measures.
	 Public will get LIVE notification about the DETECED and SUSPECTED person around to be safe.
	A Person can voluntarily TAG himself just to help the community if he/she is being suggested for quarantine.
	 A Person can be TAGGED by the Authorities and can be reached out in case of emergencies.  


If anyone wants to join in this project, please DM. 
There can be following five categories 
1.	Code Red - Detected 
a.	Admitted in hospitals or in isolation. 
2.	Code Orange - Suspected – Carrier
a.	Recent travel history from abroad and under home quarantine
3.	Code Yellow - Suspected - Community Transmission
a.	To driver/ domestic help
b.	 Person has attended function/gathering 
4.	Code Blue - Suspected - Indirect Transmission
a.	Possible in future due to indirect contact with people in point 3.
5.	Code Green – Recovered
a.	Under home quarantine post recovery for next 15-30 days as advised by medical staffs.

Implementation:
 Rather than direct surveillance through authorities a Smartphone can help us in big way because: 
a.	There are more than 80+ cr registered SIM card users in India.
b.	Even on assumption if approx 20-25% of whole population use Smartphone, it’s a good number to prevent.
c.	Minimum time and cost involved.  
This can be done in two ways 
1.	Smartphone 
CASE 1: All family members have smart phones.
	Authorities will tag Virtual Identification (VID).
	More data points.  
	God can save if they keep phone at home go for outing, but rare. 
CASE 2: Only Single family member have Smartphone.
	Authorities will tag multiple VIDs to same device.
	God can save if they are the bread earners and keep phone at home and go for outing.
2.	GPS Bracelets
     CASE 3: None of the family members have smart phone. 
	Most secure but people may feel they are under surveillance.
	Authorities have to tag and un-tag post quarantine.
	More cost and time involved. 

TAGGING:
CR(Code) – MH(State) – 400058(PIN) - 4352 XXXX XXXX 5678 (Virtual Token)
 





Corona Awareness Tracker (CAT) - Public Awareness
	A website/mobile application which will show the tagged patient densities and geo-locations within 5 km radius. 
	The application will send notification to users to remain alert if a detected person is in nearby i.e. Code Red, Code Orange and Code Yellow tagged persons in 50 meters.
GENERAL USE:           MAPPING:
  






Corona Central Room Dashboard (CCRD) – For Authorities
	Monitor the area under pin-code and contact immediately if there are any mobility breaching i.e. Code Red, Code Orange and Code Yellow.
	 They will not be able to see personal detail except geo location and contact details. 
	Alarm the officials if the device is ideal for more than 12 hrs and they should immediately reach out to the tagged person.
a.	Exception should be for kid under 5 yrs.
b.	Tagged person may have removed the mobile application/bracelet.
c.	Kept the phone at home and went outside.
